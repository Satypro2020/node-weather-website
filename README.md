# node-weather-website
This a Weather website with basic frontend to fetch weather data for a particular location built with node js. The site makes API calls to https://weatherstack.com/ and https://www.mapbox.com/.
The app can be checked out at https://pandey-weather-app.herokuapp.com/ .

Currently, the website displays weather stats such as:- temperature, feels-like, humidity. However, you can clone the repository https://github.com/Satypro2020/node-weather-website.git and make small change on the backend calls to make the website diplay even more weather information.
